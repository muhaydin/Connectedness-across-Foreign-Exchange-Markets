Connectedness across Foreign Exchange Markets

The recent Global Financial Crisis (GFC) proved how interconnectedness between markets could create a domino effect and make world economies exposed to simultaneous and negative 
effects.It would not be misleading to state that even though the GFC evolved in the US and then in the Europe as debt crisis, it has led a wide sphere of influence which eroded 
the economic performance of the world in general.

Besides the GFC caused some certain uncertainty episodes stemming from consecutive capital flows towards emerging financial markets, the post-crisis and recently normalization 
policies conducted in advanced economies also heightened the potential of these episodes.

In this context, we aim to investigate the connectedness between foreign exchange markets by estimating the average connectedness and time-varying spillover measures based on the 
method introduced by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2011 and 2012).With this study, we try to analyze how connectedness between foreign exchange markets have evolved, and to define 
which exchange rates are the contributors and receivers.
